							<Text text="1st July 2017, marks the first day the newly elected Committee and I, begin our service to you and for you for the next 2 years. This would also mean that Mdm Emily officially ends her term as the President and remain in the new Committee as the Immediate Past President. On behalf of all the members of PRULIA, I would like to record a sincere thanks to the Outgoing President, Mdm Emily Ngok as well as her Outgoing Committee for a job well done. Emily had served us as President, for 3 consecutive terms, a record of sort and did a fine job in leading PRULIA to achieve things that many thought impossible to achieve. Kudos and Thank you Emily.&#xA;&#xA;"/>
